* The Science of Chronos by Doctor Arash Khosravi
/The Science of Chronos/ is a fascinating journal written by Dr. Arash Khosravi, an Iranian physicist from the 21st century. After being diagnosed with a terminal disease, Dr. Khosravi chose to enter cryogenic freeze, a state he remained in for thousands of years until his discovery by the cryogen archeology team of the Setsafar Commonwealth. This specialized group within the Archeology Guild focuses on locating and reviving individuals who have been forgotten in cryogenic suspension due to lost records or abandoned labs.

Upon his revival, Dr. Khosravi was found to have several irreparable organs and was given mechanical replacements for his heart, liver, and parts of his brain. Despite these extensive modifications, his cognitive function was remarkably restored, allowing him to retain his identity, memories, and even a sense of loss for his long-gone family.

Dr. Khosravi's unique perspective bridges the vast gap between the 21st century and the 21st millennium. His journal, The Science of Chronos, offers a first-hand account of scientific advancements over millennia, comparing the Age of Chronos's technology with the science of his own era. His writings provide a direct narrative of the evolution of science and technology across two vastly different epochs, without any historical record of the changes in between, making it a significant contribution to the Setsafar Commonwealth's archives.

** Dr. Khosravi's Insights
Dr. Arash Khosravi's journey into the Age of Chronos has led him to a profound realization: the fundamental nature of science has shifted from focusing on the "how" and "what" to exploring the intricacies of relationships. In his time, science regarded relationships as outcomes of reality. However, in this new era, the philosophy of science sees existence itself as defined by relationships, emphasizing how interactions shape our identities and understanding of the world. For this era, relationships are not just a part of reality; they are what give life meaning.
*** Epistemology
The Christian religion believes in a triune god. God is not only self-sufficient, but he is in perfect relationship with himself. Relationship is the fundamental ingredient of the trinity of God. God created everything, and everything has the fundamental fingerprint of this relational deity.

What is the first thing we learn in life but relationships? What are the first and second commandment under which the entire law may be summed up? Love God and love neighbor. Are they not relational?

From epistemology, what is a fact? Is it not the act of relating something with either something else or some property? How do we learn? Is it not from relating the new information with what we already know? We cannot take new information in without the work of relating it with something we know.

What about Thomas Kuhn's observation about the progress of science? The unstated truth is that in order for new information that challlenges the current paradigm can be assimilated, a bridge of trust must first be built between the bringer of the new information and the larger scientific community. Relationships is a universal principle that ties into everything we know. So why not in physics?

*** From Particles to Systems
The fundamental shift is from seeing particles as the basic units of reality to viewing systems of relationships as the most essential component of nature. In this new age, no object or entity is understood in isolation. Instead, each entity’s properties and behaviors are fully dependent on its context, its interactions with other systems, and the network of relationships in which it is embedded.

For example, instead of describing an electron simply as a particle with mass and charge, we now describe it based on its relationships with the surrounding electromagnetic field, other particles, and the observer. In this sense, nothing exists independently—it is the network that defines the nature of things.

*** Probability
In the Age of Chronos, the understanding and application of probability have evolved significantly from Dr. Khosravi's era. In his time, debates raged between Frequentists, who viewed probability as the long-run frequency of events, and Bayesians, who saw it as a measure of belief or certainty given prior knowledge. However, in the 21st millennium, these debates are considered antiquated.

**** Probability in the Age of Chronos
The second great shift is in how we approach probability. In the pre-Chronos age, Frequentism dominated, where probabilities were calculated from the frequency of events in repeated experiments. But in the Age of Chronos, the world is not fixed and repetitive in the same way. Instead, probabilities are treated as dynamic, contextual, and self-updating—which brings us to Bayesian inference.

Bayesian inference works on the principle that probabilities are subjective, evolving as new information becomes available. The question changes from "What is the absolute probability of X happening?" to "Given this new information, how do we update our expectations?" It is a continuous process of refinement, where we constantly adjust our understanding based on relationships between data, models, and outcomes.

This approach better fits the complex, interrelated world of systems. Now, we ask questions like, "How do systems interact over time?" and "What new relationships can emerge to solve a problem?" The focus is on adaptability and exploration, rather than rigid certainty.

**** From Certainty to Feasibility
The Age of Chronos embraces uncertainty and complexity. Instead of searching for the final, certain answer, we ask, "What is feasible?" or "How can we make this work?"

This shift reflects the fluid, relational nature of reality. We accept that no single solution is perfect or final, but instead, we focus on optimization, adjustment, and adaptation. The universe becomes a living system where knowledge evolves, systems interact, and solutions emerge dynamically through the self-modifying process of Bayesian inference.

**** Law of Succession
Probability is foundational in the Age of Chronos, underpinning the very mechanics of their advanced technologies. The use of complex, continuously self-correcting models allows the inhabitants to manipulate quantum fields, control time dilation, and generate intense gravitational forces for closed-loop fueling systems. These same probabilistic models enable the creation of wormholes, allowing tiny ships to traverse millions of light-years in less than fifteen Earth minutes.

This reliance on adaptive probability models illustrates how far the understanding of uncertainty and prediction has advanced, moving from a static analysis of past events to a dynamic and predictive framework that shapes their reality. The Age of Chronos truly sees probability as what makes the universe go round, continuously adapting to new information and reshaping the boundaries of what is possible.

*** The Laws of Physics
**** There Are No Constants in Nature, Except That There Are Constantly No Constants
Dr. Khosravi has learned that the Age of Chronos views constants not as unchanging truths but as provisional tools that simplify models under certain conditions. The history of science is filled with constants that have been revised or discarded as understanding deepened. Some examples include:

1. Ptolemy's epicycles and deferents.
2. Roger Bacon's refractive index.
3. Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
4. Galileo's law of acceleration.
5. Descartes' quantity of motion.
6. Newton's gravitational constant and his laws of inertia.
7. Newton's speed of sound.
8. Coulomb's electrostatic constant.
9. Boyle, Charles, and Gay-Lussac's gas laws.
10. The universal gas constant.
11. Atomic weights as constants in chemistry.
Even in the Age of Chronos, constants like the Boltzmann constant, the speed of light in a vacuum, Einstein's gravitational constant, Planck's constant, and the cosmological constant have been reconsidered or replaced as new discoveries are made.

**** Constants Are Useful but Conditional
In Dr. Khosravi's reflections, constants are valuable for eliminating sporadic concerns and simplifying models, but they are always tied to specific conditions and contexts. For example, Newton's physics is still quite practical on Earth, particularly near sea level, but its applicability diminishes as conditions change, such as at high velocities or in strong gravitational fields.

**** We Always Outgrow Models
Dr. Khosravi notes that scientific models are constantly evolving. What once seemed like unchangeable truths eventually give way to more comprehensive understandings. This ever-evolving nature of scientific inquiry means that models are continually being refined or replaced to better fit new data and interpretations of reality. Thus, the Age of Chronos embraces the fluidity of knowledge and the provisional nature of all scientific constants.

*** Phillosophical Implications
The name Chronos itself, rooted in the Greek word for time, suggests that this revolution deeply involves the dynamic nature of time and change. In the Age of Chronos, time is no longer treated as a mere backdrop against which particles move, but as an integral part of how systems evolve.

**** Time and Relationships:
Time is understood through the relationships between systems. Just as Rovelli proposed that time is relational, in the Age of Chronos, the passage of time is tied to the evolution of interactions within systems. We no longer think of time as a simple linear progression but as a network of changes that occur within relationships.

**** Temporal Complexity:
The focus on systems and relationships leads to the study of complex temporal patterns—cycles, feedback loops, and emergent properties that unfold over time. Systems may change in unpredictable ways, and the ability to model and respond to these changes becomes a central focus of science.

*** Science in the Age of Chronos: Practical Shifts

**** Relational Modeling:
Scientific models now emphasize networks and interdependencies. Instead of breaking down phenomena into isolated components, models focus on how various systems interact and how their relationships evolve over time. This leads to more holistic, interconnected understandings of natural processes.

**** Adaptive Technologies:
Technologies are adaptive, drawing on Bayesian principles to self-modify and respond to changing environments. Machines, algorithms, and even medical treatments learn from their interactions with the environment, updating themselves as new information arises.

**** Collaborative Science:
The relational emphasis also shifts how scientific inquiry itself is conducted. Science becomes a more collaborative, interdisciplinary endeavor, where knowledge is shared and evolved through relationships between disciplines, institutions, and even AI systems. The boundaries between fields blur, and science becomes a dynamic, ever-evolving conversation.
