** Platos Republic

* The History of Hobbesian Nations and the Althusian Commonwealth
** The Rise of Hobbesian Nations and the Chronos Wars
   - Centralization of Power
     - Scientific and technological advancements lead to Hobbesian structures.
     - Scientists elevated into cushy government positions; research becomes politicized.
     - Competition for government funding leads to corruption and inefficiency.
   - Militarization and War
     - Hobbesian nations engage in the Chronos Wars, focusing on decapitating enemy power centers.
     - Catastrophic destruction follows, leading to societal disarray.
   - Downfall of the Hobbesian Model
     - The vulnerability of the Hobbesian model is exposed as centralized governments collapse.
     - Chaos, anarchy, and suffering spread across war-torn nations.

** The Emergence of the Althusian Movement
   - Monastic Origins
     - The Althusian movement begins as a modest monastic order committed to nonviolence.
     - Inspired by Johannes Althusius’ *On Politics* and Abraham Kuyper’s writings on Sphere Sovereignty.
   - Growth and Inclusivity
     - The movement attracts refugees disillusioned with the Hobbesian model.
     - Inclusivity is emphasized, drawing from the teachings of Lactantius and Origen.
   - Development of the Commonwealth
     - The Althusians establish a decentralized commonwealth based on mutual aid and voluntary participation.
     - The commonwealth becomes a beacon of hope in a war-ravaged galaxy.

** Integrating War-Torn Entities into the Althusian Commonwealth
   - Voluntary Integration
     - War-torn entities can join the commonwealth while maintaining their sovereignty.
     - Nations choose their level of integration and benefit from the commonwealth’s support.
   - No Tribute or Taxes
     - The Althusian commonwealth does not demand taxes or tribute from its members.
     - The commonwealth serves as an equal partner, offering assistance without demanding loyalty or payment.
   - Civil Service Selection
     - Nations that dissolve their civil governance fully integrate into the commonwealth’s volunteer-based leadership pool.
     - Governance is seen as a civic duty, with rulers serving without pay.

** Philosophical and Ethical Themes
   - Sphere Sovereignty
     - Each area of life (family, business, religion, government) operates independently but cooperatively.
     - This contrasts with the Hobbesian model, where the state dominates all spheres.
   - Inclusivity and Peace
     - The Althusians’ commitment to inclusivity and peace, inspired by early Christian thinkers, forms the moral foundation of their society.
   - Rebuilding and Symbiosis
     - The Althusians emphasize symbiosis and mutual aid in rebuilding war-torn societies.
     - The narrative explores the challenges and successes of integrating these societies into the commonwealth.

** Narrative Possibilities
   - A Refugee’s Journey
     - A refugee from a destroyed Hobbesian nation finds sanctuary in the Althusian commonwealth.
     - Their journey explores the transition from hierarchy to cooperation.
   - Tensions Within the Commonwealth
     - As more entities join the commonwealth, internal tensions arise over integration.
     - Debates over autonomy and maintaining the commonwealth’s integrity.
   - Reconciliation and Forgiveness
     - Themes of reconciliation and forgiveness are explored as the Althusians heal the wounds of the Chronos Wars.
   - An External Threat
     - A new external threat forces the Althusians and Hobbesians to cooperate.
     - Tests the Althusians’ commitment to nonviolence and inclusivity.

** Long-Term Vision for the Commonwealth
   - Evolution of Governance
     - The commonwealth evolves into a complex network of interconnected societies with varying levels of autonomy.
     - The story explores how this network adapts to new challenges.
   - The Future of the Hobbesian Remnants
     - The remnants of the Hobbesian nations either integrate or exist on the fringes of the commonwealth.
     - The narrative explores whether these remnants can embrace Althusian ideals or remain a source of conflict.
