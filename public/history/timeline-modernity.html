“‘The victors write the history,’ or so they say. Luo Guanzhong’s <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i> demonstrates another principle: ‘but the poet will prove them liars.’” — Brother Amos Kwan
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This period is known by Setsafar scholars as <b>“The Age of Regression”</b> — a time when humanity fell in love with its curiosity and growing knowledge, while regressing into <b>isolation, elitism, and moral degradation</b>. The era saw the abandonment of <b>God</b>, <b>neighbor</b>, and <b>community</b>, in favor of <b>Greco-Roman Ideals</b>, resulting in rigid patriarchal systems that limited the rights of women, abandoned community symbiosis for totalitarian structures in both Church and state, redefined its real comming of age as the <b>Dark Ages</b>.

<li><b>1250</b>: Roger Bacon lays the groundwork for the <b>so-called Renaissance</b>.</li>
<li><p>
Setsafar views Bacon’s contributions as <b>positive advancements in scientific inquiry</b>, but criticizes the later <b>secularization of knowledge</b>, when the pursuit of knowledge became <b>detached from relational wisdom</b>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“All knowledge is relational. When it is sought for its own sake, if it is sought without personal interaction with the Dao [God] and man, it is deception that we seek.” – Brother Zou Delan

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-beginning-of-the-dark-era-1300-ce-">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Setsafar calls the <b>Italian Renaissance</b> the <b>“Beginning of the Dark Era”</b>, seeing it as a return to <b>pagan ideals</b>, <b>human-centered glorification</b>, <b>hubris</b>, and <b>absolutist politics</b>.</li>
<li>The Renaissance, from their perspective, was <b>not a rebirth of wisdom</b> but a <b>reversion to adolescence</b>, glorifying <b>individual achievement</b> over <b>relational responsibility</b> and <b>symbiotic governance</b>.</li>
<li><p>
<b>“The Renaissance was a rejection of the relational worldview. It glorified man apart from his Creator” and apart from each other.</b>

While it democratized knowledge, it also <b>amplified both wisdom and error</b>, making truth more accessible, but also spreading falsehood more efficiently.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Technology is a tool we are graciously granted. It is always more than we deserve. For by it, wisdom is spread more efficiently and is made more accessible. For by it, error is spread more efficiently and is made more accessible. What error cannot account for, is its own destruction in the wake. Wisdom always bears better fruit, so technology is to be striven for, always.” — Brother Samuel Ferris

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Setsafar sees the <b>early Reformation</b> as a <b>response to the Renaissance</b>. Growing <b>superstitions</b> were rampant within the Church, and <b>state absolutism</b> was taking hold. If <b>state power</b> had fully solidified in the <b>Holy Roman Empire</b> by Luther’s day, his stance may never have succeeded.</li>
<li><p>
But alas, the Reformation <b>lost its way after Calvin</b>. It became engrossed in <b>hyper-materialism</b>, ultimately returning to <b>the same hubris</b> that fueled the <b>Renaissance</b>.

<li><b>Petrus Ramus</b> was <b>a towering figure in the reform of logic and education</b>.

<li><p>
Setsafar praises his efforts to <b>democratize knowledge</b> and <b>reject the elitism</b> of <b>university systems</b> that treated <b>logic as an abstract art</b>, rather than <b>a tool for discernment and wisdom</b>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-althusius-magnum-opus-on-politics-1603-ce-">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Setsafar sees <b>Johannes Althusius</b> as <b>the most important thinker of modernity</b>.</li>
<li>Where other political writings wrestle with <b>the control of everything</b>, Althusius focused on <b>humankind’s hearts</b>. Instead of asking <b>“how should governments rule?”</b>, he asked <b>“how should people live?”</b>. His work shows that <b>polity is the natural outcome of people living rightly</b>.</li>
<li>His work on <b>federalism and symbiotic governance</b> becomes <b>a foundational text</b> for Setsafar philosophy.</li>

<b>“Where others sought power, Althusius sought peace.”</b>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Setsafar sees these events as <b>two sides of the same coin</b>: both were responses to <b>absolutism</b>, but they unfolded in <b>very different ways</b>.</li>
<li><b>Westphalia</b> is remembered as <b>the last major triumph of relational governance</b>, a peaceful settlement that recognized <b>local autonomy and religious freedom</b>.</li>
<li><p>
In contrast, the <b>English Civil War</b> represents the <b>violent consequences</b> of <b>failing to uphold relational governance</b>, leading to <b>chaos, violence, and the temporary collapse of monarchy</b>.

You cannot understand the poverty out there, without first confronting the poverty in here.” — The Rahnami

<li>Important to note that Setsafar has accepted the scholarship of A.P. Martinich’s <i>The Two Gods of Leviathan: Thomas Hobbes on Religion and Politics</i></li>
<li><b>Hobbes’ Leviathan</b> is interpreted by Setsafar as <b>a disastrous return to absolutism</b>.</li>
<li>Hobbes, a supporter of Cromwell initially, switches back to favor Charles II after Cromwell’s failure to produce a successor. Hobbes claims to have never left Calvinism, but instead has tried to remain true to it. His hyper-materialism was Tertullian-like, not secular at all.</li>

<b>“Where Althusius preached mutual responsibility, Hobbes writes a tome defending the Divine Rights of Kings.”</b>

“By 1919 Krupp was already giving financial aid to one of the reactionary political groups which sowed the seed of the present Nazi ideology. Hugo Stinnes was an early contributor to the Nazi Party (National Socialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei). By 1924 other prominent industrialists and financiers, among them Fritz Thyssen, Albert Voegler, Adolph [sic] Kirdorf, and Kurt von Schröder, were secretly giving substantial sums to the Nazis. In 1931 members of the coalowners association which Kirdorf headed pledged themselves to pay 50 pfennigs for each ton of coal sold, the money to go to the organization which Hitler was building.” – U.S. Kilgore Comitte in their “Elimination of German Resouces”

“Robert Stinnett’s work <i>Day of Deceit</i> presents compelling evidence that Roosevelt’s administration was fully aware that economic sanctions would provoke Japan into war.

<blockquote>
<p>
“From a strategic point of view, it has to be seen as a complete failure, and yet it went on for 20 years, why did it go on for 20 years? Because the defense industry companies that make the bombs, that make the planes, that make the vehicles, and also the private military contractors that now are fighting the wars in lieu of public military personnel, they made trillions of dollars as long as the war continued. So they didn’t care if the war was ever won, the goal was for the war to simply continue forever… the point is not to win the war, but to make sure it never ends because you’re going to keep making profits.” – Daniel Kovalik
